      'Impact Investing is simply investing with a purpose. Often called a “double bottom line” investment, impact investing enables investors to put their money to good use in meaningful, intelligent ventures that provide both a financial AND a social return on their investment. This sector of investing has never been more important than it is now.  The good news is that those who believe in the value and purpose of impact investing can still obtain solid, financial returns in the process.'

      'Foundations and the ultra-wealthy have long been participants in impact investing, and only recently has this concept come into favor with everyday investors who want to make a difference and a return with their investment dollars. Opportunities to make a difference exist in housing, microfinance, healthcare, energy, food and agriculture targeted into emerging nations and here at home.  Measuring financial returns is easier and much more scientific than the new metric of measuring the social and/or environmental impact claims of an investment. This is much more challenging as some social and environmental returns of an investment can take years to quantify. As such, investors are exercising more and more scrutiny over these returns. This will be a very important topic to watch as the sector unfolds.'

      'According to Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN) survey of impact investors, 89% of those surveyed responded that their investments exceeded expectations, with financial returns that averaged only slightly lower than traditional “Market Rate Investments”. This figure is evidence that investors can do very well both financially and socially by engaging in impact investing.'

      'Impact investing assets under management (AUM), estimated by GIIN to be close to $80 billion today, is expected to grow substantially by as much as $15 billion annually as more institutional investors rush into the sector to meet the demand of their more philanthropic-minded clients.'

      'Often deemed “Doing well by doing good,” Impact Investing is expected to accelerate as tech savvy, socially-focused Millennials, who are more committed to repairing the world than previous generations, become wealthier and a significant force in the investing population. According to the Deloitte report Catalysts for Change, 75 million Millennials are positioned to become the wealthiest generation ever, surpassing the 80 million Baby Boomers. In fact, over the next 40 years, an estimated US$ 41 trillion will be transferred from Baby Boomers to their heirs, resulting in a very powerful Millennial population. This wealth transfer is likely to catapult Impact Investing into a leading asset class in the coming years.'
