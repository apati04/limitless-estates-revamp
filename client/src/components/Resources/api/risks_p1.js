    title: "Illiquidity of Real Estate",
    body:
      "Real estate is generally illiquid, meaning that it is not typically capable of being readily sold for cash at fair market value. Thus, the investment might not be able to sell properties as quickly or on the terms that it would like. We might be required to expend significant amounts of money to correct defects or make improvements before a property can be sold. Moreover, the overall economic conditions that might cause the Fund to want to sell properties are generally the same as those in which it would be most difficult to sell."
