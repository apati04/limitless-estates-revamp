          "Tucson is home to the Tucson Tech Corridor (TTC) and also several big technology companies that employ thousands of Tucson residents such as Raytheon and IBM. Tucson ranks 41 out of 200 on Milken’s Best Performing Cities in High Tech GDP Growth. In addition, much of the city's economy is centered on the University of Arizona, which is the city's largest employer, as well as tourism, with over 3.5 million people visiting the city each year. Not only does the university provide undergraduate and graduate students as a source of potential renters, but also faculty and staff. The University of Arizona area can be a goldmine for investors because rental demand insures low vacancy and higher rent than in other areas."

          "Realtor.com recently named the city the top market in the country for investors on the basis of homes' affordability and the city's relatively low unemployment rate of 7.8 percent. The national average is 8.2 percent. Forbes magazine also reported the findings. Local real estate experts agree that Tucson is a bustling market for investors and that the market is heating up. Arizona’s relatively low cost of living combined with its warm, sunny climate make it appealing to many people, particularly retirees. The job market in Tucson is growing and the population in the city continues to increase. These are two big positives for people looking to invest in rental property in the Tucson area. Experts predict that Tucson property values will continue to rise in the future. This could mean a big return for investors that buy now while home prices and interest rates are still low."
