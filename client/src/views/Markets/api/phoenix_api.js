As with the state of Arizona, the area relied on the 5 C's (copper, cattle, climate, citrus, and cotton) for its economic growth and expansion. A thriving job market is the driving force behind the city’s renaissance, with high-income positions being created in the metro area. From July 2016 to July 2017, 52,000 jobs were added in the Phoenix metro area, with 11,900 of them in the medical and education fields.  Money Magazine named Phoenix No. 3 among the country’s hottest cities for tech jobs in 2017, and Intel has announced that it intends to invest $7 billion in suburban Chandler, creating 3,000 new jobs where it already employs 11,300 people. Several Fortune 500 and Fortune 1000 companies have their international headquarters in the area, including Avnet, PetSmart, Apollo Education Group, Republic Services, ON Semiconductor, and Sprouts Farmers Market. Other Fortune 500 companies with significant presence include Banner Health, the state's largest private employer, American Airlines, which merged with Tempe-based US Airways, American Express, Wells Fargo, Boeing, and Intel, which has a large regional campus in Chandler.",
