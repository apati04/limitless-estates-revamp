            'I am the Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Limitless Estates, LLC. I am involved with all aspects of the company such as research, acquisitions, management, operations, and marketing, but have a specific focus on investor relations. I have been successful at raising over $300k to fund my own sponsorship throughout the course of 3 years during my time as a professional athlete. Through experience, I can highlight the fact that the importance of a companyâ€™s sponsorship success is defined by the end result being beneficial to both parties and the importance to have an alignment of passion and goals.',
