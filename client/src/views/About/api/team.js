      'I am the Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Limitless Estates, LLC. I am involved with all aspects of the company such as research, acquisitions, management, operations, and marketing, but have a specific focus on investor relations. I have been successful at raising over $300k to fund my own sponsorship throughout the course of 3 years during my time as a professional athlete.
