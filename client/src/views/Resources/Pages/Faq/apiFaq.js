            'In our experience purchasing and transforming neglected multifamily properties, we know that good homes make good investments. By embracing the principle of “impact investing,” we are able to invest in multi-family real estate that not only deliver strong financial returns, but also have a positive social impact on families and communities across the nation.'

        description:
            'We will typically aim to hold our properties for approximately five years (although certain properties may be held for longer or shorter periods depending on the characteristics of each property and prevailing market conditions), at which point we intend to seek a “liquidity event,” such as a sale or refinancing of the property. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully pursue a liquidity event with respect to any of our properties. Market conditions may delay or even prevent the Manager from pursuing liquidity events. If we do not or cannot liquidate our real estate portfolio, or if we experience delays due to market conditions, this could delay Investors’ ability to receive a return of their investment indefinitely and may even result in losses, notwithstanding the provisions of the LLC Agreement.'

        title: 'Are the returns guaranteed on the business packet?',
        description:
            'No. Guaranteeing a return on an investment is actually against the law. We underwrite our deals conservatively in order to try and be sure that our deals perform to expectations. With that said, we have done and continue to do research to ensure we know what is going on in the area where we are investing. We know that if our deals do not perform for our investors, our business will not succeed. We put our investors and the residents first.'

We believe that making a positive difference in the communities we invest in will impact the bottom line more than if we only look at the numbers. We don't only want good business deals, we want to help build communities up."
