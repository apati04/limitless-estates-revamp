      'Have you heard stats such as “80% of millionaires attribute their wealth to real estate”? Or heard stories of living the good life off passive cash flow from rental property? Combine this with the recent years of unpredictable, disappointing stock markets, and you get masses of people realizing they have no control over many of their investments and therefore their life savings. Tired of blindly following the crowd of 401K stuffers, many have started looking at why so many wealthy people own real estate.',
      'When it comes to real estate investments, we focus in multifamily apartment complexes because of the control it provides in determining the investments results. Some of the most powerful factors in real estate are control, debt (leverage), and taxes. For the average investor, leverage is commonly used in real estate, but not in stocks or private lending. In addition, the IRS and owners of investment rental property might as well be best friends because the IRS has made so many rules to benefit us!',
      'In multifamily (5+ units) or other commercial investment real estate, the value of the property is based on the income the property produces. This is exactly why the wealthy focus on commercial property such as multifamily apartment complexes. Being that you control the income and expenses in a property, you also control the value. What this means is if you have a way to increase income either by raising rents, billing residents back for utilities, or adding any other source of ancillary income to the operations of the property, you will also add value. Also, if you decrease expenses by renegotiating operating expense costs, billing residents back for utilities, reducing turnovers and vacancy, putting in energy efficient light bulbs and plumbing fixtures, or ANY other way to cut operating expenses, you increase the value of your property.',

    title: 'What is Impact Investing?',
    pages: [
      'Impact Investing is simply investing with a purpose. Often called a “double bottom line” investment, impact investing enables investors to put their money to good use in meaningful, intelligent ventures that provide both a financial AND a social return on their investment. This sector of investing has never been more important than it is now.  The good news is that those who believe in the value and purpose of impact investing can still obtain solid, financial returns in the process.',
      'Foundations and the ultra-wealthy have long been participants in impact investing, and only recently has this concept come into favor with everyday investors who want to make a difference and a return with their investment dollars. Opportunities to make a difference exist in housing, microfinance, healthcare, energy, food and agriculture targeted into emerging nations and here at home.  Measuring financial returns is easier and much more scientific than the new metric of measuring the social and/or environmental impact claims of an investment. This is much more challenging as some social and environmental returns of an investment can take years to quantify. As such, investors are exercising more and more scrutiny over these returns. This will be a very important topic to watch as the sector unfolds.',
      'According to Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN) survey of impact investors, 89% of those surveyed responded that their investments exceeded expectations, with financial returns that averaged only slightly lower than traditional “Market Rate Investments”. This figure is evidence that investors can do very well both financially and socially by engaging in impact investing.',
      'Impact investing assets under management (AUM), estimated by GIIN to be close to $80 billion today, is expected to grow substantially by as much as $15 billion annually as more institutional investors rush into the sector to meet the demand of their more philanthropic-minded clients.',
      'Often deemed “Doing well by doing good,” Impact Investing is expected to accelerate as tech savvy, socially-focused Millennials, who are more committed to repairing the world than previous generations, become wealthier and a significant force in the investing population. According to the Deloitte report Catalysts for Change, 75 million Millennials are positioned to become the wealthiest generation ever, surpassing the 80 million Baby Boomers. In fact, over the next 40 years, an estimated US$ 41 trillion will be transferred from Baby Boomers to their heirs, resulting in a very powerful Millennial population. This wealth transfer is likely to catapult Impact Investing into a leading asset class in the coming years.'

You make an upfront capital investment — often in real estate, a mutual fund or other equity-based vehicle — and then receive an ownership stake in that investment, from which you are paid dividends or other types of regular income.  What makes this form of income passive is that you are not directly managing the investment. Passive real estate investing, therefore, is a form of real estate investing in which you place your capital into a real estate venture that you will not have any direct responsibility for managing.", <br/>,<br/>, "If you want to get into the real estate investment game, but don't have the time to find, finance, manage, and sell properties yourself, perhaps passively investing as a limited partner is the right way for you to go.",  <br/>,<br/>, "True financial freedom is achieved when passive income outpaces living expenses, giving the investor freedom to pursue his or her passions or to accelerate their wealth creation with more aggressive investing.
