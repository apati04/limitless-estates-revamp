          I am the Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Limitless Estates, LLC. I
          am involved with all aspects of the company such as research,
          acquisitions, management, operations, and marketing, but have a
          specific focus on investor relations. I have been successful at
          raising over $300k to fund my own sponsorship throughout the course of
          3 years during my time as a professional athlete. Through experience,
          I can highlight the fact that the importance of a company’s
          sponsorship success is defined by the end result being beneficial to
          both parties and the importance to have an alignment of passion and
          goals.

          At a young age, I quickly learned the meaning of discipline and
          dedication. I picked up the game of golf when I was 10, was playing in
          competitive tournaments by the time I was 13, and by the time I was
          17, I had traveled and competed in 34 of 50 states.

          I attended UC Irvine on a full-ride athletic scholarship but was
          raised and believed to always put my academics first. I graduated from
          UC Irvine in June 2012 with a degree in Sociology and minor in Public
          Health. Out of my 4 years’ attendance, I was a 3-time Dean’s list
          honoree, 3-time Big West Scholar-Athlete, First Team All Big West, Big
          West Player of the Month in March 2012, led the nation in NCAA D1 Par
          3 scoring average in 2009 and made UC Irvine history being selected
          for 2011 NCAA All-Star golf team. I ended my amateur career with a win
          at the 2012 Long Beach City Women’s Championship, which gave me the
          confidence boost to pursue golf at a higher level.

          I competed on the LPGA Symetra Tour, Cactus Tour and Canadian Tour. I
          got through my professional golf career by the help of sponsors and
          endorsements. Since golf is an individual sport, I worked hard to
          create an image for myself and be my own brand. I learned to represent
          myself in a way that would make sponsors interested to invest in me
          and my golf game. I was successful at raising over $300k to fund my
          own sponsorship throughout the course of 3 years. Through experience,
          I can highlight the fact that the importance of a company’s
          sponsorship success is defined by the end result and being beneficial
          to both parties. In 2005, I appeared and competed on a reality TV
          show, Golf Channel’s Altered Course Montego Bay.

         Since July 2016, I have worked for Strato Partners as a Regional Sales
         Director and Assistant General Manager. In just 2 years, I now hold
         the position of General Manager. Within this job, I have made myself
         familiar and competent with defining what is important in managing a
         $4 million+ business. Strato Partners make it a #1 priority to have
         each and every guest leave with a great customer experience.

         I constantly set goals for myself, mentally and physically, and I
         persistently try to achieve them. I am continually learning to grow
         and improve as a person by pushing limits. I plan to work my way out
         of the golf industry and completely out of my comfort zone. I have
         found real estate to be my new quest and chase in life. I am driven
         and relentless, and these skills make me a valuable asset to my team.
         My goals for the future would be to become an all-around real estate
         expert, continually grow my portfolio and to be an entrepreneur duo
         with my fiancé. For me, it would be so special to be able to look back
         one day to see how far we’ve come and share the successes together.
